Contents for [The Grid](https://thegrid.io/) website built on The Grid platform. Just like every Grid site, this repository contains the site sources in two formats:

* `master` branch: Contents as normalized Markdown files compatible with tools like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* `grid-pages` branch: Actual HTML pages of the website, as designed by our AI

Content can be edited either using our web and mobile applications, or by simply pushing Markdown files to this repository.
